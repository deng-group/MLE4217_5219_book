## Content
This week, we will dive into atomistic structure, particularly the crystalline materials. We will discuss the importance of atomic structure in materials science, and explore the different types of atomic structures. We will also use `pymatgen` to manipulate and visualize crystal structures. 

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Understand basics of crystal structures.
- Understand the different types of atomic structures in materials science.
- Visualize atomic structures using Python.
- Apply symmetry, group theory, point groups, and space groups in materials science.
- Distinguish between primitive cells, conventional cells, and Brillouin zones.
- Navigate reciprocal space and identify paths within it.
- Know some crystal structure prototypes.
