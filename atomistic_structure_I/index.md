## Content
This week, we will dive into atomistic structure. We will discuss the importance of atomic structure in materials science, and explore the different types of atomic structures. We will also use Python to visualize atomic structures and calculate properties like coordination number.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Understand the different types of atomic structures in materials science.
- Visualize atomic structures using Python.
- Calculate properties such as coordination number.
- Identify molecules, graph structures, and biochemistry applications.
- Differentiate between nanomaterials, crystalline, and noncrystalline materials.
- Explain ordering, prototypes, and Wyckoff positions.
- Use structure maps to analyze materials.
- Apply symmetry, group theory, point groups, and space groups in materials science.
- Distinguish between primitive cells, conventional cells, and Brillouin zones.
- Navigate reciprocal space and identify paths within it.
