## Key Differences from Quiz 1

```{admonition} Quiz 2 Focus
:class: note
Unlike Quiz 1 which focused on foundational programming and database skills, Quiz 2 emphasizes:

- **Theoretical understanding** of computational methods (DFT, MD, optimization)
- **Integration** of multiple concepts (e.g., using optimization with DFT)
- **Advanced topics** (ML potentials, high-throughput thermodynamics)
- **Cross-week connections** (e.g., how ML potentials relate to optimization)
```
