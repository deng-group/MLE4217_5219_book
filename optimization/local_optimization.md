=======

## Gradient Descent
Principle: Move iteratively in the direction of the negative gradient.

Algorithm: x_(k+1) = x_k - α ∇f(x_k) (α = learning rate/step size)

Advantages: Simple to implement.

Disadvantages: Can be slow to converge, sensitive to the choice of learning rate, can get stuck in local minima.

Variants: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD, for large datasets, updates with a subset of the data), Momentum (adds a "momentum" term to accelerate convergence and escape shallow local minima), Adam (combines momentum and adaptive learning rates). Materials Example: Optimizing the parameters of a force field.


## Conjugate Gradient
Principle: Uses conjugate directions (instead of just the gradient) to avoid "zig-zagging" and improve convergence.

Advantages: Faster convergence than GD for many problems, especially quadratic functions.

Disadvantages: More complex than GD.

Materials Example: Geometry optimization of a molecule or crystal structure.

## BFGS and LBFGS
Principle: A quasi-Newton method that approximates the Hessian matrix to accelerate convergence.

Advantages: Often faster and more robust than GD and CG, especially for non-quadratic functions. Doesn't require calculating the exact Hessian.

Disadvantages: Requires more memory than GD or CG (to store the approximate Hessian).

Materials Example: Finding the minimum energy configuration of a complex material.

L-BFGS: Limited-memory version, suitable for large-scale problems.


## Other Local Optimization Methods
Newton's method.

Nelder-Mead (Simplex) method: doesn't require derivatives.

## How to Choose an Optimization Algorithm
Consider the computational cost of evaluating the objective function and its derivatives.

Consider the size and dimensionality of the problem.

Experiment with different methods and parameters.

Always visualize results to check for convergence and reasonableness.
