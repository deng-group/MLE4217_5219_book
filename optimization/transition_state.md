Finding transition states (saddle points) is crucial for understanding reaction mechanisms and kinetics in materials.

Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) is a widely used method for finding the minimum energy path (MEP) between two known states (reactant and product).

## Principle
Creates a "chain" of images (configurations) between the reactant and product states.

Uses a combination of spring forces (to keep the images evenly spaced) and forces from the potential energy surface (to move the images towards the MEP).

"Nudging" ensures that the images converge to the MEP and not to a local minimum.

Relatively efficient for finding MEPs.

Can be used with various energy calculation methods (DFT, force fields, etc.).

## Algorithm
Initialization: Create a series of images between the reactant and product states (e.g., by linear interpolation).

Force Calculation: For each image, calculate the spring force and the force from the potential energy surface.

Nudging: Project out the component of the potential energy force parallel to the band and the component of the spring force perpendicular to the band.

Optimization: Move the images according to the resulting forces (e.g., using gradient descent or a more sophisticated optimizer).

Repeat: Iterate until the images converge to the MEP.

## Challenges
Requires good initial guesses for the reactant and product states.

Can be sensitive to the choice of spring constant and the number of images.

May not find the true MEP if there are multiple pathways or complex energy landscapes.

## Applications
Studying diffusion pathways of atoms in solids, calculating activation energies for chemical reactions on surfaces, understanding phase transformations.
