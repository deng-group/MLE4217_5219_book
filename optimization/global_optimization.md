=======
Global methods aim to find the global minimum, even in non-convex problems.

Generally more computationally expensive than local methods.

Often involve a combination of exploration (searching the entire space) and exploitation (refining promising regions).


## Simulated Annealing
Principle: Inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. Starts at a high "temperature" (allowing exploration) and gradually cools down (focusing on exploitation). Accepts moves that worsen the objective function with a probability that decreases with temperature.

Algorithm: Metropolis algorithm (accept/reject moves based on a probability that depends on the energy difference and temperature).

Advantages: Can escape local minima, relatively simple to implement.

Disadvantages: Can be slow to converge, requires careful tuning of the cooling schedule.

Materials Example: Finding the ground state structure of a crystal.


## Basin Hopping
Principle: Combines local optimization with random perturbations. Transforms the objective function into a "staircase" of local minima.

Algorithm: Repeatedly performs local optimization (e.g., using BFGS) followed by a random perturbation of the variables. Accepts or rejects moves based on a Metropolis criterion.

Advantages: More efficient than SA for many problems, can handle rugged energy landscapes.

Disadvantages: Still requires tuning parameters (e.g., the size of the perturbations).

Materials Example: Finding stable configurations of nanoparticles.


## Genetic Algorithm
Principle: Inspired by biological evolution. Maintains a "population" of candidate solutions that evolve through selection, crossover (recombination), and mutation.

Algorithm:

Initialization: Create a random initial population.

Selection: Select the "fittest" individuals (those with better objective function values).

Crossover: Combine the "genes" (variables) of selected individuals to create new offspring.

Mutation: Introduce random changes to the offspring's genes.

Repeat: Iterate until a stopping criterion is met.

Advantages: Well-suited for discrete and combinatorial optimization problems, can handle complex and noisy objective functions.

Disadvantages: Can be computationally expensive, requires careful tuning of parameters (population size, crossover rate, mutation rate).

Materials Example: Optimizing the composition and structure of alloys, designing new materials with specific properties.

## Other Global Optimization Methods
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): Inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling.

Differential Evolution (DE): Another evolutionary algorithm.

Bayesian Optimization: Uses a probabilistic model to guide the search, particularly useful for expensive objective functions.

Random Search: Simple but effective, especially for high-dimensional problems.
