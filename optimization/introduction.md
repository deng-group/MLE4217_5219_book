## Basic Concepts

## Overview
=======
Optimization is the process finding the input values (parameters, variables) that minimize or maximize a given object function, potentially subject to constraints.

In materials informatics, we can use optimization to find the best material composition, crystal structure, processing parameters, etc., for given application where the objective function is the performance of the material, e.g. highest strength, lowest energy, specific magnetic properties, etc. 

## Why Optimization?
Accelerated Materials Discovery: Instead of relying solely on intuition, experiments, or exhaustive searches, optimization provides a systematic way to explore the vast "materials space."
High-Throughput Screening: Optimize computational workflows to efficiently screen thousands or millions of potential materials.
Inverse Design: Instead of starting with a material and determining its properties, we start with desired properties and optimize to find the material that meets them.
Process Optimization: Optimize synthesis and processing conditions to improve material quality and reduce costs.
Model Optimization Finding the best parameters of the model (e.g. Hyperparameter Optimization).

## Types of Optimization:

Unconstrained vs. Constrained: Does the problem have limits on the variables?
Linear vs. Nonlinear: Is the objective function linear or nonlinear in the variables?
Convex vs. Non-Convex: Does the objective function have a single minimum (convex) or multiple local minima (non-convex)?
Continuous vs. Discrete (Combinatorial): Are the variables continuous or discrete? Materials Example: Composition fractions are continuous; choosing between different crystal structures is discrete.
Single-Objective vs. Multi-Objective: Are we optimizing for one property or multiple properties simultaneously? Materials Example: Optimizing for both strength and ductility. (Briefly introduce Pareto fronts).
Deterministic vs Stochastic: Deterministic: the same initial condition leads to the same result. Stochastic: element of randomness.
Black-box optimization: Optimization without knowing the explicit form of the objective function.

## Key Terminology:

- Objective Function (f(x)): The function we want to minimize or maximize.
- Design Variables (x): The parameters we can change to optimize the objective function.
- Constraints (g(x) <= 0, h(x) = 0): Limits on the design variables.
- Feasible Region: The set of all possible solutions that satisfy the constraints.
- Local Minimum/Maximum: A point that is the best in its immediate neighborhood, but not necessarily globally.
- Global Minimum/Maximum: The absolute best point in the entire feasible region.
- Gradient (âˆ‡f(x)): The vector of partial derivatives of the objective function. - Indicates the direction of steepest ascent.
- Hessian (H(x)): The matrix of second partial derivatives. Describes the curvature of the objective function.
- Stationary Point: A point where the gradient is zero (could be a minimum, maximum, or saddle point).
- Convergence: The process of the optimization algorithm approaching a solution.
- Learning rate: step size.

## Visualizations
- 1D, 2D function.
- Local vs global minimum.
- Contour plots.
- Gradient.

## Challenges
High-Dimensionality: Many variables can influence material properties (composition, structure, defects, processing parameters).

Non-Convexity: The objective function is often non-convex, meaning it has multiple local minima, making it difficult to find the global minimum.

Computational Cost: Evaluating the objective function (e.g., running a DFT calculation) can be computationally expensive.

Discrete Variables: Some variables are discrete (e.g., choice of elements, crystal structure type), while others are continuous (e.g., composition fractions).

Noisy Objective Functions: Experimental data or even simulations can have noise, making optimization more challenging.

Constraints: Physical and chemical constraints (e.g., charge neutrality, phase stability).

Multi-objective optimization: Optimize multiple properties at the same time.
