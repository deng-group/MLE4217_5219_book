# Training and Validation of MLPs


## Evaluation

### UMLPs
[Matbench Discovery](https://matbench-discovery.materialsproject.org/) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of MLPs. It consists of a set of tasks that cover a wide range of materials properties, including formation energy, band gap, and elastic modulus. The benchmark is designed to test the transferability and accuracy of MLPs across different systems and chemical environments.
