## Content
This week, we will dive into database for materials informatics. We will discuss the importance of data structures and formats in database design, and explore specialized materials databases to perform tasks like querying properties. We will also use Python to call APIs and access materials data from online databases.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Understand data structures and their applications in database design.
- Recognize common database formats and select suitable ones for specific needs.
- Explore specialized materials databases to perform tasks like querying properties.
- Identify methods for generating materials data and evaluate their appropriateness.
- Use materials databases effectively to select appropriate materials based on specific criteria.
