## Assessment

- [Practice Problems](practice_problems.md) - Sample problems covering Weeks 1-5
- [Quiz 1 Guide](quiz1_guide.md) - Format, topics, and preparation tips

## Study Tips

```{admonition} Study Strategy
:class: tip
- Focus on understanding key concepts rather than memorization
- Practice the hands-on skills (Git commands, NumPy/Matplotlib, API queries)
- Review the practical notebooks from each week
- Pay special attention to integrated tasks (e.g., using Pandas with Materials Project API)
- For Week 5 (Atomistic Structures), focus on fundamental concepts - advanced topics are reading material
```
