    "## Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to Learn and Use: Python's syntax is straightforward and easy to understand, which makes it an ideal language for beginners.\n",
    "- Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language, meaning that code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.\n",
    "- Dynamically Typed: Python does not require explicit declaration of variable types, as the interpreter infers the type based on the value assigned.\n",
    "- Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a rich standard library that provides modules and functions for various tasks, such as file handling, web development, and data manipulation.\n",
    "- Cross-Platform: Python is available on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, allowing for cross-platform development.\n",
    "- Community Support: Python has a large and active community that contributes to its development and provides support through forums, tutorials, and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a versatile language used in various domains, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask make it easy to develop web applications.\n",

    "## Virtual Environment using Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is an isolated environment that allows you to manage dependencies for different projects separately. Miniconda is a lightweight distribution of the Conda package manager, which can be used to create and manage virtual environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Create a Virtual Environment using Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install Miniconda:\n",
    "    - Download the Miniconda installer for your operating system from the official website: https://www.anaconda.com/download/success\n",
    "    - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:\n",
    "    - On Windows, you can use the `Anaconda Prompt` or `Command Prompt`.\n",
    "    - On macOS and Linux, you can use the `Terminal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a Virtual Environment:\n",
    "    - Use the following command to create a new virtual environment. Replace `mle3112` with the name you want to give to your environment:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      conda create --name mle3112\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - You can also specify the Python version you want to use in the environment:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      conda create --name mle3112 python=3.12\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Activate the Virtual Environment:\n",
    "    - Use the following command to activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      conda activate mle3112\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install Packages:\n",
    "    - Once the environment is activated, you can install packages using the `pip install` command. For example, to install the `numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter` packages, use:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deactivate the Virtual Environment:\n",
    "    - To deactivate the virtual environment and return to the base environment, use the following command:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      conda deactivate\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove the Virtual Environment:\n",
    "    - If you no longer need the virtual environment, you can remove it using the following command:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      conda remove --name mle3112 --all\n",

    "- Division (`/`) divides the first number by the second. \n",
    "- Modulus (`%`) returns the remainder of the division. \n",
    "- Exponentiation (`**`) raises the first number to the power of the second. \n",
    "- Floor Division (`//`) divides the first number by the second and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Operators\n",
    "- Equal to (`==`) checks if two values are equal. \n",
    "- Not equal to (`!=`) checks if two values are not equal. \n",
    "- Greater than (`>`) checks if the first value is greater than the second. \n",
    "- Less than (`<`) checks if the first value is less than the second. \n",
    "- Greater than or equal to (`>=`) checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second. \n",
    "- Less than or equal to (`<=`) checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second.\n",

    "### Logical Operators\n",
    "- Logical AND (`and`) returns `True` if both operands are true. \n",
    "- Logical OR (`or`) returns `True` if at least one of the operands is true. \n",
    "- Logical NOT (`not`) returns `True` if the operand is false.\n",
    "- If both operands are not boolean, logical operators will return one of the operands based on the evaluation.\n",

    "### is and in Operators\n",
    "- `is`: The `is` operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory. It returns `True` if they do, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "- `in`: The `in` operator checks if a value is present in a sequence (such as a list, tuple, set, or dictionary). It returns `True` if the value is found, and `False` otherwise.\n",

    "## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. Python supports OOP and allows you to define classes and create objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We Need Classes:\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Classes allow you to bundle data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit. This helps in organizing code and makes it more modular and manageable.\n",
    "- Reusability: Once a class is defined, it can be reused to create multiple objects. This avoids code duplication and promotes code reuse.\n",
    "- Inheritance: Classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes, allowing you to create a hierarchy of classes and promote code reuse.\n",
    "- Polymorphism: Classes can define methods that can be overridden by subclasses, allowing for flexible and dynamic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.\n",
    "- Object: An instance of a class. It is created using the class blueprint and can have its own unique values for the attributes defined in the class.\n",
    "- Instance: A specific object created from a class.\n",
    "- Attributes: Variables that belong to an object. They represent the state or properties of an object.\n",
    "- Methods: Functions that belong to an object. They define the behavior or actions that an object can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Classes in Python:\n",
    "In Python, a class is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. The attributes and methods of the class are defined within an indented block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes in Python have several important features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__()` method: A special method (constructor) that initializes a new object. It's called automatically when creating a new object.\n",
    "- `.` operator: Used to access attributes and methods of an object.\n",
    "- `self` parameter: Refers to the instance of the class being created or acted upon.\n",
    "- Instance methods: Methods that can access and modify object attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Special Methods in Python Classes (Optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__str__()`: Called when converting object to string (e.g., `print(obj)`)\n",
    "- `__repr__()`: Called for object representation (e.g., in debugger)\n",
    "- `__len__()`: Defines behavior for `len(obj)`\n",
    "- `__call__()`: Makes object callable like a function\n",
    "- `__eq__()`: Defines equality comparison (`==`)\n",
    "- `__lt__()`, `__gt__()`: Define less than/greater than comparisons\n",
    "- `__add__()`, `__sub__()`: Define arithmetic operations\n",
    "- `__getitem__()`, `__setitem__()`: Enable index/key access\n",
    "- `__enter__()`, `__exit__()`: Support context manager protocol\n",
    "- `__del__()`: Destructor method called when object is garbage collected\n",
    "- `__iter__()`, `__next__()`: Enable iteration over object\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods allow you to customize how objects of your class behave in different contexts.\n",
