# Kinetic Monte Carlo
Kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) is an extension of the Monte Carlo method that is used to simulate the time evolution of a system by considering the rates of individual events. In kMC, the system is modeled as a set of discrete states, and the transitions between these states are governed by transition rates. By simulating the stochastic evolution of the system based on these rates, kMC can provide insights into the dynamics of complex systems and predict their behavior over time.
