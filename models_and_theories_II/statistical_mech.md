# Statistical Mechanics in a Nutshell

Once we have a model to describe the interaction between atoms, we can run atomistic simulations to study the behavior of the system. However, the number of atoms in a system can be very large, making it computationally expensive to simulate the dynamics of each atom. This is where statistical mechanics comes in. Statistical mechanics provides a framework to describe the behavior of a system with a large number of particles by considering the statistical properties of the particles rather than the individual dynamics of each particle.

## Microstates and Macrostates

In statistical mechanics, a system is described by its microstates and macrostates. A microstate is a specific configuration of the particles in the system, while a macrostate is a collection of microstates that share certain macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure, and volume. The behavior of a system is described by the probability distribution of its microstates, which gives the likelihood of finding the system in a particular microstate.

## Ensemble
Ensemble is a collection of systems that share the same macroscopic properties but may differ in their microstates. There are several ensembles in statistical mechanics, such as the microcanonical ensemble, canonical ensemble, and grand canonical ensemble, which are used to describe systems with different constraints, such as fixed energy, temperature, or chemical potential.
