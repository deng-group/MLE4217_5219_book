# Machine Learning I
```{admonition} Before we start
:class: warning
This week, we just briefly recap the basic concept of machine learning. We assume you have already know a bit about machine learning. A detailed introduction to the machine learning can be found in the [MLE5217 Foundations of Machine Learning for Materials Science](https://nusmods.com/courses/MLE5217/foundations-of-machine-learning-for-materials-science).

## Content
This week, we will cover the basic concepts of machine learning, including the types of machine learning, the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, and the importance of data preprocessing. We will also discuss the different types of models used in machine learning, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. Additionally, we will cover the concepts of overfitting and underfitting, as well as the importance of model evaluation and validation. In practical, we will use PyTorch to perform some basic machine learning tasks.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic concepts and types of machine learning.
- Differentiate between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Recognize the importance of data preprocessing in machine learning.
- Identify various machine learning models such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
- Explain the concepts of overfitting and underfitting.
- Evaluate and validate machine learning models effectively.
