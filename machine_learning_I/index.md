# Machine Learning I

```{admonition} Reading Material
:class: note
**This chapter provides foundational ML concepts for Week 12 (Machine Learning + ML Potentials).**

Please review these materials BEFORE Week 12 lecture. They will NOT be covered in detail during lecture time. Topics include:
- Regression and fitting
- Neural networks
- Decision trees and Random Forest
- Classification
- Principal component analysis (PCA)
- Clustering

These concepts are assumed as prerequisite knowledge for understanding ML Potentials.

```{admonition} Before we start
:class: warning
This week, we just briefly recap basic concept of machine learning. We assume you have already know a bit about machine learning. A detailed introduction to machine learning can be found in [MLE5217 Foundations of Machine Learning for Materials Science](https://nusmods.com/courses/MLE5217/foundations-of-machine-learning-for-materials-science).

## Content
This week, we will cover basic concepts of machine learning, including types of machine learning, difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, and importance of data preprocessing. We will also discuss different types of models used in machine learning, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. Additionally, we will cover concepts of overfitting and underfitting, as well as importance of model evaluation and validation. In practical, we will use PyTorch to perform some basic machine learning tasks.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand basic concepts and types of machine learning.
- Differentiate between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Recognize importance of data preprocessing in machine learning.
- Identify various machine learning models such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
- Explain concepts of overfitting and underfitting.
- Evaluate and validate machine learning models effectively.
