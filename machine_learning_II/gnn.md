# Graph
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of neural networks designed to work directly with graph-structured data. They have gained popularity due to their ability to capture the relationships and dependencies between nodes in a graph, making them suitable for various applications such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and molecular chemistry.

## Beyond Feature Vectors
### Classical Approaches and Their Limitations

Traditional machine learning relies on flat feature vectors, which struggle with the complex connectivity and geometry of systems like atomic structures. Standard neural networks face challenges with permutation invariance and varying input sizes, limiting their effectiveness.

### Structure-Aware and Generative Models

Material properties depend on atomic topology and geometry, necessitating graph-based models for learning structural information. Beyond property prediction, generative models enable the design of novel materials with desired properties, advancing materials discovery.

### Advanced Techniques

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from graph-structured data, while Diffusion Models offer cutting-edge solutions for generative tasks, driving innovation in materials science.

## Graph
A graph is a mathematical structure consisting of nodes (or vertices) and edges (or links) that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, and can represent various types of relationships between entities.
