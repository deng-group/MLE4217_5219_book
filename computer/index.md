## Content
This week, we will explore computer hardware and software, starting with the history and development of computer systems. We will examine computer architectures, focusing on the basic components such as the CPU, GPU, memory, and storage. We will discuss the differences between CPUs and GPUs, their roles, and functionalities. Additionally, we will cover fundamental programming languages and libraries, and assess the performance of your code using Python libraries. Finally, we will demonstrate version control with git and collaboration using GitHub. 

## Learning Objectives
- Know the history and development of computer systems
- Understand the basic components of a computer system
- Understand the differences between CPU and GPU
- Understand the differences between different programming languages
- Test the performance of your computer code
- Use git and GitHub to manage your code repository
