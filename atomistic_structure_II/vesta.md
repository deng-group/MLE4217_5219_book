# Practical: Visualize Crystal Structures Using VESTA
In this practical, we will use VESTA to visualize crystal structures, particularly CIF files. VESTA is a 3D visualization program for structural models, volumetric data such as electron/nuclear densities, and crystal morphologies. It can be used to create a variety of plots, such as ball-and-stick, polyhedral, and thermal ellipsoid plots. VESTA is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download VESTA from [here](https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/).

## Download a CIF File from ICSD
Download the CIF file for the crystal structure of $BaTiO_3$ from ICSD. You can access the ICSD database from [NUS Library](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/chemistry/databases).

## Open a CIF File
- Open VESTA and click on `File` > `Open` to open the downloaded CIF file.

- You should see the crystal structure of $BaTiO_3$ displayed in the VESTA window.

## Change Orientation
- You can click and drag the mouse to rotate the crystal structure in the VESTA window. You can also use the arrow keys to rotate the structure.
- You can type `projection vector` (e.g. [1,1,1]) and `upward vector` (e.g. [0,0,1])in the `Orientation` tab to change the orientation of the crystal structure.

## Change Boundary
On the left panel, click `Boundary` in the `Display Style` tab to change the boundary of the crystal structure.

## Change Bonds
On the top menu, click `Edit` > `Bonds` to change the bonds in the crystal structure.

## Change Style
- Atoms, Bonds, and Polyhedra style: On the left panel, click `Properties` to change the style of the atoms in the crystal structure.
- Switch between ball-and-stick, space-filling, polyhedral, wireframe, and stick: On the left panel, change the style of the atoms in the crystal structure under `Style`.

## Draw Lattice Planes
On the top menu, click `Edit` > `Lattice Planes` to draw lattice planes in the crystal structure.

## Show Polyhedra
On the left panel, click `Style` > `Polyhedra` to show polyhedra in the crystal structure.

## View Site Properties
Click a site in the crystal structure to view its index, coordinates, occupancy, supercell coordinates, Wyckoff notation, and thermal displacement parameters.

## Measure Distances, Angles, Interfacial Angles, and Dihedral Angles
On the left panel, click relevant icon to measure distances, angles, interfacial angles, and dihedral angles in the crystal structure.

## Show Thermal Ellipsoids
On the left panel, click `Properties` > `Atoms` > `Atom style` > `Show as displacement ellipsoids` to show thermal ellipsoids in the crystal structure.

## Save Image
Click `File` > `Export Raster Image` to save the image of the crystal structure.

## Convert to Other Formats
Click `File` > `Export Data` to convert the crystal structure to other formats.
