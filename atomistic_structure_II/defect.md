# Defective Structure

In the previous chapter, we discussed the ideal atomic arrangements in crystalline materials. However, in reality, perfect crystals are rare. Most materials contain various types of structural imperfections, such as defects, interfaces, and grain boundaries. These imperfections can significantly influence material properties, including mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal stability.

## Point Defects
Point defects are the simplest type of structural imperfections in crystalline materials. They involve the presence of atoms at lattice sites that are different from the ideal atomic arrangement. Point defects can be classified into three main categories: vacancies, interstitials, and substitutional defects.

### Vacancies
A vacancy occurs when an atom is missing from its lattice site. This defect creates a local distortion in the crystal structure, leading to changes in material properties. For example, vacancies can increase the diffusion rate of atoms in a material, affecting its mechanical and thermal properties.
- Schottky defect: A type of point defect in which oppositely charged ions are missing from their ideal lattice sites.

### Interstitials
An interstitial defect arises when an atom occupies an interstitial site within the crystal lattice. This defect can introduce strain and alter the electronic properties of the material. Interstitial atoms can also act as impurities, affecting the material's mechanical and electrical behavior.
- Frendel defect: An interstitial defect in which an atom occupies an interstitial site in the crystal lattice.

### Antisites
Antisites are substitutional defects in which an atom occupies a lattice site that is different from its ideal position. This defect can disrupt the crystal structure and lead to changes in material properties. Antisites can affect the material's electronic, optical, and magnetic properties, making them essential for understanding the behavior of complex materials.

## Supercell
Crystal structures have periodicity, which means that the arrangement of atoms repeats itself in space. However, defects can disrupt this periodicity. To model defective structures, we use a supercellâ€”a larger unit cell that contains the defect. By introducing a defect into the supercell, we can study its impact on material properties.
