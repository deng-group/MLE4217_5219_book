# Noncrystalline Materials

Noncrystalline materials, also known as amorphous materials, lack the long-range order that is characteristic of crystalline materials. This lack of long-range order is due to the absence of a repeating unit cell, which is a defining feature of crystalline materials. Noncrystalline materials are characterized by a disordered atomic structure that does not exhibit the periodicity of a crystal lattice. This disordered atomic structure gives rise to unique properties and behaviors that distinguish noncrystalline materials from their crystalline counterparts.

## Short-Range Order Parameters
Short-range order (SRO, 0 ~ 5 Å) refers to the spatial correlations between atoms over short distances in a material. In noncrystalline materials, the lack of long-range order results in a complex and disordered atomic structure that exhibits SRO features. Analyzing the SRO in noncrystalline materials can provide insights into their local atomic arrangements, coordination environments, and bonding interactions.
### Radial (Angle) Distribution Function (RDF/ADF)

The radial distribution function (RDF) is a measure of the distribution of atoms in a material as a function of distance from a reference atom. The RDF quantifies the probability of finding an atom at a given distance from the reference atom and provides information about the local atomic structure of the material. The RDF is a useful tool for characterizing the short-range order in noncrystalline materials and can reveal important structural features, such as the coordination number, bond lengths, and bond angles.

The angular distribution function (ADF) complements the RDF by describing the angular correlations between neighboring atoms. The ADF helps analyze the bond angles and geometric arrangements, offering further insights into the short-to-intermediate range order in noncrystalline materials.

### Voronoi Tessellation
Void space in noncrystalline materials can be analyzed using Voronoi tessellation, which partitions space into polyhedral cells around each atom. The Voronoi cells represent the local environment of each atom and can reveal the distribution of voids, defects, and structural motifs in the material. Voronoi tessellation is a powerful tool for characterizing the short-range order and structural heterogeneity in noncrystalline materials.

### Coordination Number
Coordination number is the number of nearest neighbors surrounding an atom in a material. In noncrystalline materials, the coordination number can vary due to the disordered atomic structure and the absence of long-range order. The coordination number provides information about the local atomic environment and bonding interactions in noncrystalline materials, helping to understand their structural and mechanical properties.

## Medium-Range Order Parameters
Medium-range order (MRO, 5 ~ 20 Å) refers to the spatial correlations between atoms over intermediate distances in a material. In noncrystalline materials, the lack of long-range order results in a complex and disordered atomic structure that exhibits MRO features. Analyzing the MRO in noncrystalline materials can provide insights into their structural motifs, connectivity, and clustering behavior.

## Glass Transition Temperature
Glass transition temperature ($T_g$) is the temperature at which an amorphous material undergoes a transition from a rigid, glassy state to a more flexible, rubbery state. Below $T_g$, the material behaves like a solid, with a high viscosity and low molecular mobility. Above $T_g$, the material transitions to a liquid-like state, with increased molecular mobility and reduced viscosity. The glass transition temperature is an important property of noncrystalline materials and influences their mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties.
