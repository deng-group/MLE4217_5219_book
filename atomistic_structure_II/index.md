## Content
This week, we continue our exploration of atomistic structure, building upon the foundational concepts we've already covered. Our journey begins with an introduction to SMILES and graph representations of molecules, powerful tools for describing and manipulating chemical structures.

Next, we'll investigate site properties within a material's structure. Understanding the characteristics of individual atomic sites is crucial for predicting a material's behavior.

We will then explore structure descriptors tailored for non-crystalline (amorphous) materials, which lack the long-range order of crystals. Describing these structures requires different approaches, and we'll introduce some of the key techniques.

Finally, we'll introduce the fundamental concepts of defects and interfaces in materials. Defects are deviations from perfect crystal structure, while interfaces are boundaries between different materials or regions within a material. Both play a critical role in determining material properties.


## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Understand and utilize SMILES notation and graph representations to describe molecules.
- Analyze and interpret site properties within a material's structure.
- Apply appropriate structure descriptors for characterizing non-crystalline (amorphous) materials.
- Explain the fundamental concepts of defects and interfaces in materials and their influence on material properties.
