## Content
This week, we delve deeper into the fundamentals of atomistic structure. We begin with an exploration of the supercell concept, which lays the groundwork for modeling periodic arrangements within crystalline materials. The discussion then shifts to the use of Cartesian and fractional coordinatesâ€”two essential frameworks for describing atomic positions and lattice dynamics.

Another topic is Wyckoff positions, highlighting their significance in understanding crystallographic symmetry. In addition, we investigate various types of structural imperfections, including defects, interfaces, and grain boundaries, and discuss their profound impact on material properties. Finally, we round off the chapter with an overview of non-crystalline materials, contrasting their disordered atomic arrangements with the ordered structures of crystals.

This comprehensive introduction sets the stage for a deeper understanding of the structural aspects that govern material behavior.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Understand the supercell concept and its role in modeling periodic structures.
- Differentiate between Cartesian and fractional coordinate systems.
- Analyze Wyckoff positions and their importance in crystallographic symmetry.
- Examine various structural imperfections, including defects, interfaces, and grain boundaries.
- Contrast crystalline and non-crystalline material structures.
