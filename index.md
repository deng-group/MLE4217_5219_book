# Welcome
ðŸ™Œ **Welcome to Materials Informatics (MLE4217/5219)**! ðŸŽ‰ This interactive textbook will make you success!

ðŸ‘‹Hey there! With the rise of materials databases, computing power, and smart algorithms, we can now use data-driven methods to speed up the discovery, development, and design of new materials. This is super important for modern research and development. For instance, machine learning can help us optimize manufacturing processes, extend the life of rechargeable batteries, and even assist in drug discovery. There are tons of opportunities in this field, and we're excited to explore them with you in this course.

Our goal is to make this course practical and helpful for you. We'll cover the basics and some industry-standard tools that you might not have encountered before. 

The field is evolving quickly, so we can't promise that everything we teach will be the latest and greatest. But if you have any suggestions, we'd love to hear them!

For more details about the course (like the syllabus, calendar, and rules), check out [Syllabus](syllabus.md), [Calendar](calendar.md), and [Orientation](orientation/orientation.md).

# Navigation
You can quickly navigate through the sections using the navigation bar on the left side. There is also a search box to help you find any content in this course swiftly. To get started, you can use the navigation bar and begin with the [Orientation](orientation/orientation.md).

# Running the Jupyter Notebook Using Colab
You can run the Jupyter notebooks in this course using Google Colab. Click the little rocket button if you see it to open the notebook in Colab. You can then run the code cells and interact with the notebook as if it were on your local machine.

# Contact
Please feel free to contact me through email at [msedz@nus.edu.sg](mailto:msedz@nus.edu.sg) if you have any questions or suggestions. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
